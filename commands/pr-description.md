# pr-description

Generate a pull request description for the current branch changes.

## Usage

```
claude pr-description
```

## Title

The title of the pr should adhere to our git conventional commit guidelines to make our titles consistent.

## Description

This command generates a comprehensive PR description by comparing the current branch to the head of `main` using `git diff main...`. The PR description is saved as a markdown file in the `/pr-descriptions` folder.

If the `/gh-issue` command was used and Claude knows what {{scm.provider}} issue the branch is for, the PR description should begin with `closes #<github-issue-number>`.

## Output

- **Location**: `/pr-descriptions` folder
- **File naming**: `pr-description-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md` or descriptive name based on feature
- **Format**: Markdown with clear section headers
